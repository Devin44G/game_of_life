# John Conway's Game of Life!

### For this iteration of *The Game*, I am using ReactJS (for the sake of practicality).

### Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Grid Complete
  - [x] Decide upon a Canvas-based Grid **or** an Array-based Grid?
  - [x] Define grid size
  - [x] Get grid rendering
  - [x] Add click event to fill in a grid block with color to signify "dead" or "alive" blocks (for testing purposes)
- [ ] Games Rules Complete
  - [x] Tile can "look" for neighboring tiles relative to its position
  - [x] Introduce game rules to logic
  - [ ] Introduce a readable *rulebook*
- [ ] Extra features
  - [ ] Produce pre-set <b>*Still Lifes*</b>
  - [ ] Produce pre-set <b>*Oscillators*</b>
  - [ ] Implement "click-through" animation (click through game, one step at a time)
- [ ] Game complete
